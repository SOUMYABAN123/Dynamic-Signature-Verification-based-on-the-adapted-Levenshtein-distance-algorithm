# Dynamic-Signature-Verification-based-on-the-adapted-Levenshtein-distance-algorithm
The aim of this experiment is to design, implement, and evaluate a dynamic (online) signature verification system based on a string-based representation of signature dynamics and an adapted Levenshtein (minimum edit) distance algorithm
